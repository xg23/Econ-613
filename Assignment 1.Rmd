# Read data

```

## Exercise 1
* Number of students: 340823
* Number of schools: 6165
* Number of programs: 33
```{r}
pgm <- stu %>% 
  select(starts_with("choice")) %>% # get a subset of stu (choicepgm1 ~ 6)
  map(., function(x) unique(x)) %>% # find the number of programs in each "choicepgm"
  unlist %>% 
  unique() %>%  # join all the unique programs in 6 choices and find the unique value. 
  # Note that one program does not have a name. 
  length() 
```

* Number of choices (school, program): 
```{r}
stu1 <- stu %>%
  subset(., is.na(.[5:16]))
  
 #  drop_na(., schoolcode1:choicepgm6) # tease out NAs in shool and program choices
  
  
#  map(., function(x) gsub("^$|^ $", NA, x)) # replace all empty cells with NAs. 

  
 


```

* Missing test score: 179887 (number of NAs in "score" in datstu)
* Apply to the same school (different programs)
```{r}

```

* Apply to less than 6 choices: 20988

```{r}
# rule out NAs in choicepgm, leaving us students who apply 6 choices
stu3 <- drop_na(stu, starts_with("choice"))

# then students who apply less than 6 choices should be total number of students minus those who apply 6 choices:
340823 - count(stu3)

# na.omit(stu[11:16])

```


```{r}
summary(stu)
summary(sss)
```
